Create a react app. The app should get information from the Chuck Norris jokes Api.

Firstly create a dropdown list populated from the data received from https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/categories

When selected the category result of the dropdown list should be placed into the following URL

https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}

fetch this data and display the results on the browser.

Make it as colourful and fantastic as you like. 

Look at the website https://api.chucknorris.io/ 
for further information.

Only requirements is that you use useReducer, useEffect and useContext. 

If you can incorporate a custom hook into your app please do so. 

The data receieved will be one joke at a time. Create a button to re-fetch another joke. Also changing the category will cause a re-fetch.
